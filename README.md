# Web Development Project 1 - Portfolio Website
This project is part of the Udacity Front End Web Developement Nanodegree. For this project, I built a portfolio of projects website. A mockup of the website design was provided as a PDF-file, and I replicated that design in HTML and CSS. The website was developed to be responsive that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects. 

## General Information

/CSS/ folder contains the following two files for styling and responsive design: main.css responsive.css

/Images/ folder contains all the images used on this website.

To install just clone or download the files.
